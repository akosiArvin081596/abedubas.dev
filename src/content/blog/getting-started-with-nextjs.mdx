Next.js has become the go-to framework for building React applications, and version 15 brings exciting new features that make development even more enjoyable. In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up a Next.js project and share some best practices I've learned from building production applications.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improved SEO and faster initial page loads
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-rendered pages for optimal performance
- **API Routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive routing based on your file structure
- **Built-in Optimizations** - Automatic image optimization, code splitting, and more

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configured out of the box.

## Understanding the App Router

Next.js 15 uses the App Router by default, which introduces several powerful concepts:

### Server Components

By default, all components in the `app` directory are Server Components. This means they render on the server and send HTML to the client, resulting in faster page loads and better SEO.

```tsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello from the server!</h1>;
}
```

### Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `"use client"` directive:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some tips I've learned from building production Next.js applications:

1. **Keep Server Components where possible** - Only use Client Components when you need browser APIs or React hooks
2. **Use the Image component** - It provides automatic optimization and lazy loading
3. **Leverage Static Generation** - Pre-render pages at build time when data doesn't change frequently
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Use error boundaries and the built-in error pages

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a powerful framework that makes building modern web applications a breeze. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex enterprise application, Next.js has the tools you need to succeed.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific topics like data fetching, authentication, and deploying to production. Stay tuned!
